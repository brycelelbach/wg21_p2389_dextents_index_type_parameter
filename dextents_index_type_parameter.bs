Abstract: [[P2299R3]] added `dextents` to make it less verbose to use `mdspan` in common cases. Later, an index type parameter was added to `dextents`, which increases its verbosity, defeating its original purpose. We should fix this.

# Background # {#background}

[[P0009R18]] added `mdspan`, a non-owning multidimensional span abstraction
  to the C++ Standard Library.
It is excellent and flexible, allowing users to customize customize data
  layout, access method, and index type.
However, this flexibility often comes with verbosity.

The length of each dimension (the extent) of an `mdspan` are represented by an
  `extents` object, and each extent may be expressed either statically or
  dynamically.  Use cases based on P0009R18's wording would look like this.

```c++
// All static extents
mdspan<float, extents<64, 64, 64>> a(d);

// All dynamic extents
mdspan<float, extents<dynamic_extent, dynamic_extent, dynamic_extent>> a(d, 64, 64, 64);

// Mixed static and dynamic extents
mdspan<float, extents<64, dynamic_extent, 64>> a(d, 64);
```

[[P2299R3]] sought to improve `mdspan`s usability
for one of the most common cases: when all extents are dynamic.
First, it added deduction guides
to make class template argument deduction (CTAD) work
for `mdspan` and `extents`.

```
std::vector<float> storage(64 * 64);
mdspan a(storage.data(), 64, 64); // All dynamic.
```

However, CTAD does not help in all situations.
For example, it cannot be used when declaring
a class member or a function parameter.

```c++
struct X {
  std::mdspan<float, std::extents<std::dynamic_extent, std::dynamic_extent, std::dynamic_extent>> a;
};

void f(std::mdspan<float, std::extents<std::dynamic_extent, std::dynamic_extent, std::dynamic_extent>> a);
```

To simplify these cases, [[P2299R3]] also added `dextents<N>`,
a template alias for an `extents` with `N` dynamic extents.

```c++
template <std::size_t N>
using dextents = /* ... */;

struct X {
  std::mdspan<float, std::dextents<3>> a;
};

void f(mdspan<float, std::dextents<3>> a);
```

# Problem # {#problem}

Originally, `mdspan` and `extents` used a fixed index type (`std::size_t`).
However, the signedness and size of the index type
can affect performance in certain cases.
So, [[P2553R1]] parameterized the index type used by `mdspan` and `extents`.
As a part of this change, an index type template parameter was added to
  `dextents`.

```c++
template <class IndexType, std::size_t Rank>
using dextents = /* ... */
```

This change has made using `dextents` more verbose, which is unfortunate, as
  the main purpose of `dextents` was to make common uses as simple as possible.

```c++
struct X {
  std::mdspan<float, std::dextents<std::size_t, 3>> a;
};

void f(mdspan<float, std::dextents<std::size_t, 3>> a);
```

Index type customization is an important feature for `mdspan` to support, but it
  is not something that most users will need to use or think about.
If they do need it, they can always use the more verbose `extents`.

# Proposed Changes # {#proposed-changes}

In R0, we originally proposed removing the index type parameter from `dextents`
and making it always use `size_t` as the index type.
For example, instead of typing `dextents<int, 3>` as an alias for
`extents<int, dynamic_extent, dynamic_extent, dynamic_extent>`,
users would type `dextents<3>`.

This would have been a source-breaking change.
As of the publication date,
MSVC's STL and LLVM's libc++ are already shipping `dextents`.
GCC's libstdc++ is not shipping `mdspan` yet.
However, since `dextents` is a template alias,
it would have had no ABI impact.

LEWG reviewed R0 and voted against the breaking change.
Instead, LEWG approved our alternative design:
leave `dextents` alone, but add a new `dims` template alias.
LEWG asked us to adjust the `dims` design
by adding an index type template parameter as its _last_ template parameter,
and defaulting it to `size_t`.
The resulting alias looks like this.

```c++
template<size_t Rank, class IndexType = size_t>
using dims = dextents<IndexType, Rank>;
```

Before adding this alias, the above use cases
where CTAD could not be used would look like this.

```c++
struct X {
  // Member declaration
  std::mdspan<float, std::dextents<std::size_t, 3>> a;
};

// Function parameter
void f(std::mdspan<float, std::dextents<std::size_t, 3>> a);
```

After adding this alias, those two use cases would look like this.

```c++
struct X {
  // Member declaration
  std::mdspan<float, std::dims<3>> a;
};

// Function parameter
void f(mdspan<float, std::dims<3>> a);
```

The result is even more compact than `dextents`.
It also abbreviates a more familiar word, "dimensions."

# Note on freestanding # {#freestanding}

<a href="https://wg21.link/P2833R2">P2833R2</a>,
adopted in Kona 2023, added an `// all freestanding` comment
to the beginning of the
<a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/mdspan.syn">[mdspan.syn]</a>
synopsis.
In our view, our proposal would not change this freestanding status.

# Implementation # {#implementation}

We have implemented the proposal as
<a href="https://github.com/kokkos/mdspan/pull/324">Pull Request 324</a>
in the reference mdspan implementation.

# Wording # {#wording}

> Text in blockquotes is not proposed wording,
> but rather instructions for generating proposed wording.
> Markup `@_something something else_@` indicates that
> the text "something something else" is to be rendered in italics,
> without the additional `@_` or `_@`.
>
> Make the following changes to the latest C++ Working Draft as of the time of writing.
> All wording is relative to the latest C++ Working Draft.
>
> In [version.syn], increase the value of the `__cpp_lib_mdspan` macro
> by replacing YYYMML below with the integer literal
> encoding the appropriate year (YYYY) and month (MM).

```c++
#define __cpp_lib_mdspan YYYYMML // also in <mdspan>
```

> In the `<mdspan>` header synopsis [mdspan.syn],
> after the declaration of `dextents`,
> add the following declaration of `dims`.

```c++
// [mdspan.extents.dims], @_alias template_@ `dims`
template<size_t Rank, class IndexType = size_t>
  using dims = @_see below_@;
```

> Immediately after section [mdspan.extents.dextents],
> insert a new section "Alias template `dims`" [mdspan.extents.dims]
> with the following wording.

```c++
template<size_t Rank, class IndexType = size_t>
  using dims = @_see below_@;
```

*Result*: A type `E` that is a specialization of `extents` such that
`E::rank() == Rank && E::rank() == E::rank_dynamic()` is `true`, and
`E::index_type` denotes `IndexType`.
